# Solidity Vulnerability Scanner Requirements
#
# Core dependencies: None (uses only Python standard library)
#
# For development dependencies, see pyproject.toml [project.optional-dependencies.dev]
#
# Note: This scanner uses regex-based parsing. For production use,
# consider integrating with solidity-parser-py or py-solc-x for
# more accurate AST parsing.
#
# Optional: For enhanced parsing (future improvements)
# solidity-parser-py>=0.1.0
# py-solc-x>=1.1.0
